                        <p>"Hi, my name is Agius and I rap things! I started rapping because no one would buy my beats, but that was actually the start of this weird, fun journey. When I started rapping, I realized that I actually had some things to say. A message to breathe life back into the world. I do that by sharing my experiences and wisdom that I've gained that I've gained through my life.</p>
                        <p>I have a big heart for people and their passions, which I try to make evident in my music. I hope to inspire my listeners to keep their faith in Christ, keep it simple, and strive for life. We get so caught up in situations up in situations that are not worth our time and energy. We just need to put away those childish things.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, I want to pursue starting a record label/ministry/business. Just know when I do something, I want to do it all. I love the idea of music, design, podcasts and things of the like to be affordable and empowering. The goal is to have a sort of hub where I can have these kinds of services/content that will spread the message.</p>
                        <p>Last but not least, I'm <b>releasing</b> my new <b>EP:</b> "Things To Say" on <b>Friday,  August 11, 2017</b>. Please be on the lookout for that because, well, I've got some things to say. Love you all."</p>

                        <p>She probably won't ever read this in her lifetime, TBH lol. But should that stop me? Nah'. Check it, being a single-parent is hard, man. However, being a single-parent with two children at significantly different age timleines, while being financially unstable is insanely harder. Never her fault, she pushed on and adapted to her environment because to her being comfortable was knowing that her children were comfortable and she succeeded with what little resources she had. She raised her children correctly. She starved because her children were fed. She was cold because her children were warm. And she cried because her children were happy. Despite being physically and emotionally uncomfortable, she was mentally and spiritually comfortable because we were PEMS comfortable.</p>

                        <p>So this summer I stayed in Plano, Texas for multiple reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>I was living in Jester East at UT Austin, so I definitely had to leave the dormitory as you're not allowed to stay past the end of finals unless you want to pay in the thousands... a crime..</p>
                            <p>I needed a job..</p>
                            <p>I'm in a long-distance relationship..</p>
                            <p>I'm not down to live in a pre-war studio with two other people in Manhattan... nor am I down to brave the thousand degree heat in the Rio Grande Valley, despite there being so much to do.. /s</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Much like engineering, life is all about trade-offs. Sometimes we have to give up one to gain another. We all live unique lives, but the way it is lived - regardless of our spiritual state - is up to us embodying the ability to adapt to our environment for one clear purpose: being comfortable -- whether it is forged for physical, mental, emotional, and/or spiritual purposes. All of us - regardless of our earthly financial state - live on a currency called time, and this currency is borrowed.</p>
                        <p>It is up to us to decide how we want to be comfortable and then decide when to adapt to reach this state of comfortability, as we watch our share of borrowed time leave our coffers.</p>

                        <p><i>"I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem // Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome // I'm kinda young -- but my tongue speaks maturity // I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security"</i></p>
                        <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, Edward Archer (Special Ed) was only 16 when this song released. <i>I Got It Made</i> -off of the <i>Youngest in Charge</i> album- became a mega-hit. Special Ed's gift of speech is definitely a blessing and really helped paved the way for cats in the golden era of hip hop.</p>
                        <p>His tone just embodies all aspects of being calm, cool, and collect. Lyricism aside... his tone is what, in my opinion, helps a writer portray their message in a way everybody can become engulfed.</p>

                    <h4><b>Elvin J. Galarza</b></h4>
                    <p>Hola and welcome to my personal blog! Here is where I unravel my thoughts, aspirations, and memes all into one big, somewhat organized piece of scrap on le internet. Each day I have something different to say. And each day I speak not to impress or entertain but to de-stress in a healthy way, sitting 1.5 feet away from a big screen. Aside from the risks of impaired vision and carpal tunnel, I tend to have spontaneous thinking... so approach this blog with care, don't facecheck, ss, and keep all finger(s) on your scrolling device as you journey through the archives of my mind. Enjoy!</p>
