      <h5>I Got It Made - Special Ed (1989) <span class="w3-opacity">[July 31, 2017]</span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><i>"I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem // Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome // I'm kinda young -- but my tongue speaks maturity // I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security"</i></p>
      <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, Edward Archer (Special Ed) was only 16 when this song released. <i>I Got It Made</i> -off of the <i>Youngest in Charge</i> album- became a mega-hit. Special Ed's gift of speech is definitely a blessing and really helped paved the way for cats in the golden era of hip hop.</p>
      <p>His tone just embodies all aspects of being calm, cool, and collect. Lyricism aside... his tone is what, in my opinion, helps a writer portray their message in a way everybody can become engulfed.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for next Monday as I cover another tone-similar... Gifted vernacular... Unlimited Rhymes filled... Universal-ly respected skill... a backronym that serves its justice, the great Guru.</p>

      <h5>Comfortability and Adaptability: the Genesis of Revelation <span class="w3-opacity">[August 1, 2017]</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>So this summer I stayed in Plano, Texas for multiple reasons:</p>  
      <ul>
          <p>I was living in Jester East at UT Austin, so I definitely had to leave the dormitory as you're not allowed to stay past the end of finals unless you want to pay in the thousands... a crime..</p>
          <p>I needed a job..</p>
          <p>I'm in a long-distance relationship..</p>
          <p>I'm not down to live in a pre-war studio with two other people in Manhattan... nor am I down to brave the thousand degree heat in the Rio Grande Valley, despite there being so much to do.. /s</p>
      </ul>    
      <p>Much like engineering, life is all about trade-offs. Sometimes we have to give up one to gain another. We all live unique lives, but the way it is lived - regardless of our spiritual state - is up to us embodying the ability to adapt to our environment for one clear purpose: being comfortable -- whether it is forged for physical, mental, emotional, and/or spiritual purposes. All of us - regardless of our earthly financial state - live on a currency called time, and this currency is borrowed.</p>
      <p>It is up to us to decide how we want to be comfortable and then decide when to adapt to reach this state of comfortability, as we watch our share of borrowed time leave our coffers.</p>

    <p>What better way to dedicate my first ever homage on my first ever legitimate website than to spend it on my ma'?</p>
    <p>She probably won't ever read this in her lifetime, TBH lol. But should that stop me? Nah'. Check it, being a single-parent is hard, man. However, being a single-parent with two children at significantly different age timleines, while being financially unstable is insanely harder. Never her fault, she pushed on and adapted to her environment because to her being comfortable was knowing that her children were comfortable and she succeeded with what little resources she had. She raised her children correctly. She starved because her children were fed. She was cold because her children were warm. And she cried because her children were happy. Despite being physically and emotionally uncomfortable, she was mentally and spiritually comfortable because we were PEMS comfortable.</p>
    <p>Ain't no mother better than a mother whose others are together even in dark weather.</p>
    <p>I work hard so that one day I can just come close to giving back to her. One day I will take her to the Vatican, so that growing up in the streets of Manila just to be impoverished in the States in order for her children to have better opportunities will be worthwhile.</p>
    <p>One day, ma'.  Un día. Isang araw.</p>

      <h4><b>Elvin J. Galarza</b></h4>
      <p>Hola and welcome to my personal blog. Here is where I unravel my thoughts, aspirations, and memes all into one big, somewhat organized piece of scrap on le internet. Each day I have something different to say. And each day I speak not to impress or entertain but to de-stress in a healthy way, sitting 1.5 feet away from a big screen. Aside from the risks of impaired vision and carpal tunnel, I tend to have spontaneous thinking... so approach this blog with care, don't facecheck, ss, and keep all finger(s) on your scrolling device as you journey through the archives of my mind. Enjoy!</p>

        <span class="w3-large">Two for Tuesday</span><br>
        <span>Kinda' like present day radio stations, instead of two consecutively played songs from the same band, I will be doing two random topics. Said topics are decided whenever they feel like knocking on the door of my mind. I will offer them music, mead, and gossip. And in return they will be provided with lodging. ** little do they know they will be here for eternity **</span>

        <span>If you're looking for cheap alcohol, BAC 404. Because I actually <i>seriously</i> abstain from alcohol, Thirsty Thursdays serves as a day to briefly enjoy (in)formally talking about what I physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually (a.k.a. PEMS in the Elvin dictionary{}) thirst for. </span>

        <span>This site is about me, and if you know anything about me it's that I enjoy hyping people up and learning about what their aspirations, goals, and accomplishments are. This day serves as a day of exposing people from all walks of life, in hopes of giving said person another file for internet users to search for.</span>

        <span>What better way than to nearly end my week with negative situations that I find myself in? Let's hope and pray that I have less Saturdays on this blog than I do of any other day. Here is where I will talk about my problems and how I am trying to fix them. I find that writing out my problems aids in the efforts to solve them.</span>
