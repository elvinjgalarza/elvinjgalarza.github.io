                        <h5>The Dunning-Kruger Effect <span class="w3-opacity">[September 21, 2017]</span></h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>Aside from this Texas heat and the obvious weather changes occurring around the world, a lot of us might feel hot. I'm talking about mentally, psychologically if you will. You've been drinking Dunning-Kruger Effect potions, my guy.</p>
                        <h3><b>What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) you ask?</b></h3>
                        <p>According to almighty Wikipedia, DKE is the <h4>"cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognititve ability as greater than it  [actually] is."</h4></p>
                        <p>It's basically thinking you're - excuse my french - hot sh!@ when you're literally hot sh!@, smelly, left unflushed type sh!a.</p>
                        <p>Now I am not one to judge, but in the technical majors - especially CS and ECE - it is very easy to run into so many DKE people. Peers aside, I've had so many TAs that are so condescending and overbearingly brutal and critical when giving feedback and then later on I see them struggling in courses that I'm taking the following semester.</p>
                        <p>Around this time I start to find more. LOL. See, around this time is when all of us begin sending in our summer internship applications to companies we aspire to be with, so you'll definitely overhear some conversations about "Oh, I'll never get a C (maaaaybe a B, maybe), imagine if Google saw that?" or "Apple? Him... he got into Apple? Are you kidding me?"</p>
                        <p>Now it's important to understand the difference from  cocky condescending people and people with DKE. Some people are just really good at what they do, but express it in a negative destructive way.</p>
                        <p>People that fall under DKE don't understand the limitations or boundaries of their skillset. No one wants to appear clueless. However, this is dangerous as this can lead to people not soaking in new information.</p>
                        <p>Psychologists have found that the "lower a person's ability is at something, the more likely they are to overestimate the ability in that skill". Now it's fairly safe to say that all of us have felt this effect at at least one point in our lives, big or small. However, there are people who embody and live in DKE.</p>
                        <h3><b>How do I deal with someone who has DKE?</b></h3>
                        <p>I am no psychologist, but I feel like the first step should be to acknowledge that someone is under DKE.</p>
                        <p>Now what? Avoid them. Dont waste <i>your</i> time trying. That's it.</p>
                        <p>Your goal should never be to put someone down and make them feel worthless or unintelligent. Don't try to prove to your peer that he/she is ungifted or untalented. </p>
                        <p>I think there is literally nothing we can do. Sometimes people just don't get what they are, and we just have to accept that.</p>
