                            <p>Christopher Columbus: the great explorer, the fortuitous discoverer, the brave navigator, and the mighty colonizer.</p>
                            <h3><b>OR</b></h3>
                            <p>Christopher Columbus: the subjugator, the history rewriter, the perpetrator of the American holocaust, and the ending, raping, pillaging, kidnapping + enslaving, and removal of the Indian people.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Should the Christopher Columbus statue stay up in Columbus Circle? And should we even celebrate Columbus day?</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>A lot of us know about Columbus' discovery of the "New World". Though, to be fair to all of the people in the world, is it really a New World? See, it is believed that there was once a land bridge - the Bering land bridge - connecting the Old World to the New World, i.e., Asia to North America.</p>
                            <p>During the Ice Age, it is believed that people used the Bering land bridge to migrate into the Americas some 14,000 years ago. These nomadic peoples relied on hunting huge game, such as the wooly mammoth. As game decreased from hunting, these wandering hunters moved on to where the food supply was. They ventured throughout North America; some followed the coast and others went their own way. The migration of the Americas took thousands of years, and its source was eventually cut off when the ocean levels rose. However, these people flourished and thrived and went on to discover different types of technologies. Perhaps, a land of the lost.</p>
                            <p>To fast forward and get to the point, Columbus wasn't the first. Nor was he even the second!</p>
                            <p>Lief Erikson, a Norsemen ("Northmen") - or Viking, a name most of us are more acquainted with - and his band traveled as far west as the coast of modern day Canada. They established a short-lived colony, Vinland, but it proved impermanent for unclear reasons; however, it was most likely due to the great distance from their homeland and even political turmoil while over there. So to put it plainly, <b>no one</b> was down or even ready to go that far. And for what? Nations had wars to take care of and political power and wealth to gain. As a result, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, America was basically unknown to all of Europe... BUT they had heard of Asia from Marco Polo and other travelers. Spices. Spices. Spices.</p>
                            <p>So here's the problem:</p>
                            <p>Spain was super jealous of Portugal, and I mean mad jealous. It's like when someone breaks up with their partner, and their ex is suddenly out in the world doing better, and that ex is Portugal. For centuries, Spain thought of Portugal as one of its provinces, but were finally forced to recognize Portugal's independence from Spain. On top of <i>that</i>, Spain was trying to drive the Moors - the North African Muslims who ruled a huge portion of Spain for centuries - out. So Portugal goes out and does some exploring while Spain is doing its thang and stumbles upon hella' gold in Africa; Portugal then establishes a sea route to pick up all this gold and bring it back home to make the country extremely wealthy.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>So at this point Spain is fed up. They hire Christopher Columubs to launch a program of exploration and do what Portugal did. Now Columbus had an idea. He proposed that earth is like an orange, spherical, and that the most direct route to the Indies - and to the wealth that the Indies had - was the least obvious one - at the time. In order to travel east to the Indies, he said he should travel west instead and cross the Atlantic. Eventually he'd go all the way around and reach the Indies. Now this is an amazing idea; however, no one had ever done it and so it was very bold, but also very wrong. He miscalculated the distance to travel to the Indies, not taking into account the New World because to them there was only one world, the world they knew, which was understandable.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>So should we celebrate? Should we erect statues in his name? Or should we change the holiday, California did it. And put down statues like the Confederate idolizations already being brought down?</p>
                            <p>We could argue that because of Columbus, we probably wouldn't even be here talking about this. And that Columbus was acting during the scope of thought in the 1490s. To take him down would be to erase history for what it was. The fact it's raised issues shows enlightenment. Keep it up to remember our past and not repeat it.
                            <p>Yet another could argue that a human life back then is just as important now. That we have textbooks for the purpose of remembering.</p>
                            <p>Now even another may argue that perhaps we should rename the holiday, but instead of replacing the statue we should modify it to remember the ones lost  and slamming the bad things he caused, while still praising the good that he did do.</p>
                            <p>So what should <i><b>we</b></i> do?</p>
