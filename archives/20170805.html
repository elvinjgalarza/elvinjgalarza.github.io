                        <p>So I'm currently in a time where I didn't think I'd be for maybe years from now, when I would become financially stable, have a home and a beautiful family. See, God works in mysterious ways, no doubt. And you really never know the final outcome of something or why it is happening.</p>
                        <p>My father has been battling cancer for over a year now. First there was a tumor in his brain. After chemo and radiation, the tumor was removed. However, it appeared that the doctors were too late,and so he then had a tumor in his lymph nodes. After a series of chemo and radiation, it was also removed. By this time my father had become very ill.</p>
                        <p>A lot of us have heard stories of chemo and radiation -- that it not only kills the bad cells, but also kills the good ones too. What I didn't know is exactly how it deteriorates the body. My father -- before cancer -- was known for being likened to that of the build of John Cena. I mean my dad's body was forged from 40 years of all types of arduous manual labor. He didn't only lose his voice... he lost his appetite, an appetite not only of physicality but of living. That void has been filled with the appetite of being loved.</p>
                        <p>I will be going back to McAllen this Monday to give my father love -- a love that has been physically and publicly absent for over 12 years now as divorce has its ways -- as he lives his final moments in hospice as his body succumbs to Stage IV non-small terminal lung cancer.</p>
                        <p>My father has had a rough life. Raised in Brooklyn, all he's known is grit. A part of me fears that he will show emotion, yet another part of me yearns for it. He's a strong man, the strongest I know. This transition of events seems too sudden, although having its own gradual slope. He's had several wives and children before my mother, so I have half-siblings... it's going to be hard these next few days explaining to them the situation as some of them are not very fond of my father. And now it turns out my half-sister's son has a tumor as well... My abuela lives with him now after her step-husband passed around the time of my father's initial start with cancer. When he goes, I don't know where she will go... as I have literally zero family in the states. She will <i>not</i> go to a nursing home, I assure you that. There's a lot of responsibility a person at my age is fortunate not to have. However, I am used to it as this has been the case growing up with a single-mother and being the only male and eldest.</p>
                        <p>I've also quit my second job, after being stiffed and only averaging 5% in tips last night on a Friday at Friday's that's always busy on Friday. Had two booths that decided they were only ordering for their one child, respectively. And then several big tops that decided to only tip $5-$8 on $100+ tabs. And also an elderly couple, who seemed to dislike the cards that life dealt them and so needed to take it out on me. I've never lashed out at a customer, despite whatever emotional and mental stress I'm undergoing. The way I work is I turn the other cheek. I thanked every single table for their presence, apologized for my service, and let them live their own lives while I battle with mine.</p>
                        <p>"I caught you staring hard, kid. There shouldn't be a lot on your mind at this age.", anon manager. When a coworker asked how my night was, all I could respond with is that it's going and I go whatever God gives. And in my mind all I could think of is that these people here get theirs now, but later I'll have mine. All people have hardships that they don't speak of. It's best to step back, and observe with couth for we all must meet our moment of truth.</p>
                        <p>Pray for us.</p>
